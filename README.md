# GitHelloWorld
This is the beginning of my github traveling, have fun! 
I have a problem of managing my program , and I always forget my code which amended by myself; 
On the other hand, I just want to share my programs with others who can join with me together, contributing to a perfect code;
Moreover, I would like to cooperate with people if they need my help and make a good team.
